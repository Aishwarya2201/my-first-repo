Follow [this link](./README.md)

using local workflow is simple :

*Initialise the work directory
*Modify your project 
*add the files to the staging area
*commit to your changes

Using the remote workflow seems complicated, but is actuall easy:

*add remote url as url
*modify your project
*add the files to the staging area
*commit your changes
*push changes onto the remote
